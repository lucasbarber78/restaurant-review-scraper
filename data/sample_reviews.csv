TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,George N,2025-03-01,Mar 2025,5.0,Rustic but Wow,"This place is as rustic on the inside as it is on the outside but do not let that stop you from going to one of the best seafood joints on the east coast. The food is amazing and the views of the sunset over the marshes are spectacular. Highly recommend the fried shrimp and hush puppies!","Food Quality, Environment/Atmosphere",Positive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,John Tanner,2025-03-10,Mar 2025,5.0,A must visit for terrific seafood,"What great seafood! This is a fun, ramshackle spot with broad porches and a beautiful view of the water and sunset over the marshes. The food is sensational! For fun details on virtually the entire menu, see my blog and search Bowens.","Food Quality, Environment/Atmosphere",Positive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,Maria L,2025-02-15,Feb 2025,4.0,Good food but long wait,"We arrived on a Saturday evening and had to wait almost an hour for a table. The fried seafood platter was delicious though, and the view made up for the wait. Just be prepared if you're coming during peak hours.","Food Quality, Wait Times, Environment/Atmosphere",Positive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,Robert J,2025-02-07,Feb 2025,2.0,Overpriced and underwhelming,"The hush puppies were over cooked and tasteless. The fries weren't good either. I think the grease they used to cook everything was old and needed to be changed. This plate of food cost $33! All three of us at the table agreed and didn't eat much of our food.","Food Quality, Pricing",Negative,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,Susan M,2025-01-30,Jan 2025,3.0,Mixed feelings,"The oysters were fresh and delicious, but the service was extremely slow. We waited 45 minutes after ordering to get our food. The view of the marsh is beautiful though and I enjoyed the rustic atmosphere. Might come again during off-peak hours.","Food Quality, Service, Wait Times, Environment/Atmosphere",Neutral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,David K,2025-01-25,Jan 2025,5.0,Fantastic local seafood,"Don't let the humble appearance fool you - this place serves some of the best local seafood I've ever had. The steamed oysters were incredible and the Frogmore stew was packed with fresh shrimp. The staff was friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. It's a bit out of the way but absolutely worth the drive.","Food Quality, Service",Positive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,Jennifer P,2025-01-15,Jan 2025,1.0,Dirty restaurant with rude staff,"This restaurant is disgusting. The food is greasy and overpriced. Food all over the floor and the bathrooms were filthy. The staff was rude when we asked for extra napkins. I would NEVER recommend this place and was definitely disappointed after reading positive reviews.","Food Quality, Pricing, Cleanliness, Service",Negative,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,Michael W,2025-01-05,Jan 2025,4.0,Great spot for casual seafood,"Awesome local spot with a real Lowcountry feel. The fried shrimp platter was excellent and the cocktail sauce had a nice kick to it. It's definitely casual dining - you order at the counter and bus your own table. The sunset view over the marsh was beautiful. Would definitely return!","Food Quality, Environment/Atmosphere, Service",Positive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,Thomas B,2024-12-28,Dec 2024,5.0,Hidden gem!,"Local Seafood House - Excellent Food and Service! The restaurant is located on the water at the end of a dirt road - don't be fooled - the food is going to be amazing! To be clear - if you are looking for white glove service - go elsewhere! BIR is your local restaurant that provides great food where everybody is welcome!","Food Quality, Service, Environment/Atmosphere",Positive,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
TripAdvisor,Bowens Island Restaurant,Patricia H,2024-12-20,Dec 2024,3.0,Good food but too expensive,"The seafood was well-prepared and fresh, but I was shocked by the prices. $18 for six fried shrimp seems excessive, even for a tourist area. The atmosphere is nice with the marsh views, but I'm not sure the value is there compared to other seafood places in the area.","Food Quality, Pricing, Environment/Atmosphere",Neutral,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g54171-d436679-Reviews-Bowens_Island_Restaurant-Charleston_South_Carolina.html
