Renee S.,2025-02-07,5,"Bowen's Island Restaurant is a Lowcountry gem that perfectly embodies old-school charm with its no-frills, laid-back atmosphere and unbeatable fresh seafood. The oysters, harvested straight from Charleston's saltwater beds, taste as if they were crafted by Atlantis itself--briny, rich, and full of oceanic depth. The shrimp, hushpuppies, and fried fish are equally fantastic, prepared simply to let the freshness shine. The rustic setting, with stunning marsh views, adds to the experience, making it feel like a step back in time to a place where good food and good company matter most. If you're after authentic, fresh seafood with a side of coastal nostalgia, Bowen's Island is a must-visit.",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Natalie H.,2025-03-29,4,"Good seafood with a gorgeous view. I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes with pimento and honey. We also ordered oysters, fried oysters, hush puppies, and the frogmore stew. They also offer several local beer and cider options and they have live music on Wednesdays!
While the atmosphere was breezy and beautiful, the wait time for our food was extremely slow. Our first item (fried green tomatoes) arrived about 45 minutes after we placed our order. Our second item (oysters) arrived another 30 minutes later. After another hour of waiting, we asked someone about the rest of our order. She was kind and said she would ask the kitchen about it... we waited another 40ish minutes and right when I was about to go ask again, our food arrived. Thankfully, it was a nice day and my cousin and I had a lot to catch up on, however, we both agreed we wouldn't typically wait over 3 hours for our food. The restaurant has several levels and buildings which I imagine makes it difficult for servers to find customers and serve them their food. It was a full house, so I can respect needing to wait a while, however the process from ordering to serving and eating could use some re-organization for increased efficiency and decreased wait times.",Yelp,Service,Negative
Misha C.,2024-11-23,4,"Excellent Charleston long term establishment. Great waterfront location. (You can literally rent kayaks and SUP boards on site from COA-depending on day/time)
Drive up to the restaurant can feel a bit like an off road experience but just take it slow and steady. Parking is off to the right of the main area.
Typically we enjoy the steamed local oysters (served by the bucket) however today we hit the 'iin between' the open kitchen so our options were raw or fried. So fried it was, and it was delicious.
Definitely recommend the fried shrimp platters. Good serving size, lots of tasty fries and a couple slightly sweet hush puppies. Pro tip, add some Texas Pete to the tarter sauce. Use that with everything, especially the side of slaw. Yum! Crab cakes were a good size but probably would stick with just the shrimp next time.
Service from our daytime bartender was quick, knowledgeable and fun. Exactly what you hope for when you sit at the bar.
Tks for the good eats and pretty views. We will be back after 4:30pm for those steamed oysters soon!",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
John M.,2025-04-07,3,"Food quality and service were good. Nice location over looking the marsh. The problem is the lack of cleanliness. In other states the Health Department would have an issue with their operation.",Yelp,Cleanliness,Negative
Neil M.,2025-04-05,2,"Driving up we thought, 'Wow! This place is going to be great.' Sadly, the food was VERY average. The crab cakes were quite good but nothing else was special and some items, like the shrimp and grits and she crab soup were average at best... the fried oysters were fair. Forget the service. Usually if you sit at the bar you get good attention. Not here today. We had to ask for utensils, napkins, a clean place to sit... I don't get the positive reviews. Really good views and all, but not much else to favorably report on.",Yelp,Food Quality,Negative
Aarti R.,2024-10-30,5,"I cannot say enough good things about Bowen's. I went there for the first time over the summer and was blown away by the absolutely stunning views of sunset along the marsh.
The food was a treat from start to finish. We had the crab dip - it was love at first bite, I just wish there was more of it. We also had some cocktails to enjoy.
The service at Bowen's was great too! Ordering our food was a breeze and it came out 10/15 minutes later, leaving ample time to enjoy being outdoors and the sights.",Yelp,Environment/Atmosphere,Positive
Rick T.,2025-01-29,4,"Awesome location really great food but too pricey for lunch. But if you're on vacation not from the area you need to try at least once.",Yelp,Pricing,Neutral
Karen R.,2024-11-09,4,"Out in the middle of no where. Definitely off the beaten path. Kind of like hole in the wall from the atmosphere where locals bring their family & friends that are visiting. At peak times they also have an outside food stand. Pictures look spacious but hard to get a table. Food service is self serve ordering, and pick up when they call your name, so people stay at tables longer than a regular restaurant.
Worth it all when sun sets over the water.",Yelp,Environment/Atmosphere,Positive
Debi R.,2025-01-21,5,"Great service in a nice atmosphere. The menu has a good selection of entrees and the nightly specials are worth a try! Cocktails are good and the sangrias are my favorite. The servers are all like a family and remember their return customers by name. I recommend for a date night or just a good meal with friends.",Yelp,Service,Positive
Tracy M.,2024-12-21,1,"I would've liked to give this place a try but we waited around and nobody ever came out so we could place and order. It was noon on a Saturday and they were definitely open. One other family was there and had some drinks and apps. The views would've been great but the windows were not clear and you could barely see it.",Yelp,Service,Negative
Tammy J.,2024-10-22,2,"Yuck.
Fried green tomatoes were awesome, hence two stars.
Otherwise, I'm not sure why they can't get any color on their fried food, but I learned not to order that long ago. Tonight I ordered shrimp and grits and asked what it was like. The guy asked what I meant. I said well there's no info online, does it have peppers, onions, tomatoes, sausage? He said yes, all that.
But no, none of that, except two thin, quartered pieces of sausage. A gelatinous goo for sauce, bland grits, and some pale tiny shrimp--for $25. Oh, and lots of free shrimp shells by accident.
Plus it was super hot and they didn't want to open windows (no AC) because it was 'cold this morning.' Well now it's 80 degrees and 5pm, so....
And don't fall for the big tip suggestions, because no matter what you ask for (plates, silverware...), they point you to where you can get it yourself. There's zero service. So much crappy attitude. I don't get the popularity of this place.",Yelp,Food Quality,Negative
Jennifer D.,2025-01-30,5,"The seafood was absolutely amazing. Service was great. The lady at the bar was very southern and sweet. I love the lowcountry vibe here. Had fried shrimp that was fried perfect. My husband had fish that was also great. Recommend this place to anyone looking for a local low key vibe.",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Gonzalo H.,2024-09-07,5,"Very tasty, fresh and abundant. Nice view. Convenient location and generally staff. Worth trying",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Heather V.,2024-08-18,2,"Underwhelming. Tiny menu. Almost everything is fried. One kind of oyster. Divey bar atmosphere.
If you want a nice, delicious seafood place - this is not it!!! My fav item I got was the hush puppy for gods sake!
Pretty view of the swamps with the sunset, but that's about it.",Yelp,Food Quality,Negative
Mary S.,2024-12-20,5,"Seafood always fresh,a little outside but worth it, just bring a jacket or go sit inside. Sunset always sets the mood. Service is always fast and southern hospitality.",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Jody S.,2023-12-18,5,"I have been to Bowen's twice, once about 20 years ago and this past weekend. The experiences were both great but very different. Twenty years ago it was a cash only place that would bring a shovel full of food and dump it on the table. Now the experience has changed a little (draft beers are available, credit cards are accepted, etc.) but the food is still great and it still has that dive restaurant charm.
Oysters is the main staple at Bowen's. Oysters are available in almost every way you can imagine (raw, steamed, chargrilled, etc.). We ordered 18 raw (9 local and 9 from NC) as well as a frogmore stew, fried green tomato and pimento cheese appetizer, she crab soup and chicken tenders. The fried green tomato appetizer was good but I thought they fried the tomatoes a little too much. The chicken tenders were well cooked however they have no flavor whatsoever. I would not recommend them at all. Now the oysters, soup and frogmore stew were all top notch. These are their main staples and you can tell this is why people go.",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
J P.,2025-03-23,5,"Great food & good service. Really relaxed atmosphere and awesome oysters! We sat inside and had no problem getting a table. They also have a great drink selection.",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Genevieve V.,2023-12-17,5,"I have heard the legend of Bowen's Island Restaurant since I was a child, but for one reason or another have never been myself...until now. It totally lives up to the hype.
The atmosphere is part dive bar, part seafood house. And the food is incredibly surprising. You walk in through the 'original' oyster room filled with graffiti and oyster tables, which were mostly empty since we went around 4:30p. All that changed on our way out and the place was PACKED around 6.
You order what you want at the counter snd are given separate numbers for oysters and kitchen food. Oysters are served downstairs at a table with 1 guy roasting and putting clusters on trays. $30 gets you a really nice sized tray. It said 12-ish cluster, but I think we were probably closer to 15/20.
3-4 mins in the steamer and the most perfect and delicious meal you've ever had awaits. Make sure you grab your gear (oyster knife & towel), maybe a sleeve of saltines and bottle of cocktail sauce/texas pete on your way back to your table. Perfection.
My friend ordered the crab cakes which were also A+++. A perfect evening!
One note of caution - the oyster guy works for cash tips, so make sure to bring cash to throw his way!",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Preston B.,2024-05-26,5,"Killer seafood shack! Definitely the epitome of a dive bar. But the beer selection was awesome. The seafood was wildly fresh and flavorful. And the ambiance was perfect if you're looking for a laid back lowcounty hangout. Absolutely worth the drive from whereever you're staying in the Charleston area",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Victor D.,2023-10-13,4,"Ok, this review is for only eating one dish because we were so full coming here but needed to try this place out.
The vibe here is that it's extremely casual and you are here to just chill with some friends and want to talk and hang out with some fast bites that you get your hands dirty with.
Got the peel and eat shrimp to start. Let's just say, even though we weren't hungry, we got another order too. The shrimp is sooo fresh and tasty. Has a little sweetness to it and the cocktail sauce was the perfect complement to it (not the other random sauce they serve with it).
My only regret coming here was that I wasn't MORE hungry so I could eat more. It's cheap, fast, tasty, what's not to like?",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Tarheel F.,2024-10-18,5,"Coolest restaurant ive ever been to! The oysters were perfect, Ivan steamed them just right! Crab dipmqas phenominal, and top it off with dolphins on the water!!?",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
haley p.,2024-08-31,1,"I dont know what the hype is they expect a tip
For practically a self service dirty establishment with no customer service for the $240 dollar mediocre fried food with no condiments or sauces is not acceptable the person taking the order is both bartending and cashier i dont know where the james beard award story came from but this is a dirty no service seafood shack so sorry i drove from charlotte for this",Yelp,Service,Negative
Kaitlin G.,2024-09-15,4,"Loved the view. Great food. You order when you arrive at the counter and then find somewhere to sit with your number. Wish they had more sauce options. Food was fresh and delicious.",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
Lynn M.,2024-08-27,5,"Doesn't get any better than this!!!! Seriously, the view alone makes me want to move!!",Yelp,Environment/Atmosphere,Positive
Steve M.,2024-02-09,2,"This review is strictly about customer service. I write this review in hopes the owner or management will make a simple change.
The wife and I decided to go to Bowen's Island to get local steamed cluster oysters for Lunch.
I tried confirming if the restaurant served Oysters during Lunch by 1st reviewing the website Clearly there was nothing that said you can't get oysters at lunch as there is just one menu.
I tried calling and got a recording with no way to talk to anyone. Again, nothing that indicated that oysters were NOT served during lunch. Upon arrival there is a sign that states oysters are not served until after 3:00. Since we already drove 40 min through traffic we went in to confirm.
When the person at the restaurant confirmed we could not get Oysters until later, I suggested they make a note on their website or on their phone message. I got the impression, this had been suggested to management before, but it falls on deaf ears. This tells me that management would rather piss off their possible customers in hopes they will still eat there once they arrived. We did not stay, and most likely won't go back until such time as management shows they cares about customers.
Again, hopefully management will see this review and make the necessary minor requested adjustment so others won't waste their time.",Yelp,Service,Negative
Frank G.,2024-06-14,3,"It's been many years since I've been here! Nothing has Changed!! Food fresh and fantastic! Prices very very very high. View is to die for. However, the place is messy, dirty, hot, sticky. They really need to clean it up. Looks like no $ have been spent in this area.",Yelp,Cleanliness,Negative
GB F.,2024-08-30,2,"Have been here many times. Slowly deteriorating in quality, value for price and customer service, not to mention cleanliness. So let's begin:
The food: it's fried seafood fare, the quality is ok but the price has gotten outrageous.
Service: bar style. You walk up to get what you want, no problems there. Fair selection of drafts
Ambiance: this was my biggest problem. The place always had a dicey dive bar vibe and never looked too clean but this last time, I smelled a very strong smell of sewage. Initially thought maybe the marsh and oysters, however upon walking downstairs to the oyster bar, I noticed underneath the bathroom there was a leaking pipe and the disgusting smell of obvious....sewage. Sanitation needed and major repairs to the property.",Yelp,Cleanliness,Negative
Angel M.,2024-01-20,1,"I went here once and it was awful!
There were a ton of mosquitoes and the screens were ripped so they were inside.
It was a beautiful location though.
The food was awful. It was fried in what tasted like old oil.",Yelp,Food Quality,Negative
Chris W.,2024-12-06,2,"I truly loved the original Bowens so was looking forward to visiting the renovated one. The place looks great and the view still stunning but the 'new' Bowens reminds me of the many, many chains out there. There's a condiment station that did not have melted butter or horseradish which is a basic for me. The bottles were gross, sticky and not labeled so you basically need to put some of each on your plate to taste. But you had to hold your plate in one hand while doing this since the station had spilled condiments all over it- really gross. I had to go down several flights of steps for the oysters I ordered, then back up to our table - then back down and up again after realizing I forgot oyster shuckers. Not an easy task for an older gal. After spending years vacationing at Folly, we realized much that we loved has changed and overpriced. If I do visit again I will go early for a sunset drink and forgo the food.",Yelp,Cleanliness,Negative
Lexi G.,2023-06-22,4,"This was such a fun place to come for a break from the boat! Stop in for a drink and bathroom break, what more could one need?! We had the peeled shrimp (so much came with it for an appetizer!!! It was easily a whole meal for one of us) and the fish and shrimp fried platter. Fish was flaky, but kind of fell apart :/ shrimp was amazing. Took a really long time to get the platter.
also, the platter came was some delicious hush puppies!!!!! I ordered a strawberry margarita and it was ehhhhh not great. Even after adding more strawberry to it, it still tasted so watery and bland.",Yelp,Food Quality,Positive
